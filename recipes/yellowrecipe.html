                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Corn Pudding is beloved throughout my family. I grew up
                    eating my mom’s corn pudding for every holiday and plenty of
                    Sunday dinners in between.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Savory corn pudding. To keep it from separating, take it out
                    of the oven while it is still "wiggly" in the center. Then
                    give it a quick flash under the broiler to brown it.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided, plus more for
                        pan
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        1 cup finely grated Parmesan or Dry Monterey Jack,
                        divided

                    <li>
                        2 cups mushrooms, such as chanterelles, torn or cut into
                        small pieces

                        3 ounces very thinly sliced country ham or prosciutto,
                        chopped
                    </li>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Arrange a rack in lower third of oven and preheat to
                        350°. Generously butter an 8x8x2" glass baking dish.
                        Sprinkle evenly with 2 Tbsp. cheese.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Melt 1 Tbsp. butter in a medium skillet over medium
                        heat. Add mushrooms; cook, stirring occasionally, until
                        golden brown and skillet is dry, 5–7 minutes. Season to
                        taste with salt and pepper. Transfer mushrooms to a
                        small bowl; set aside. Wipe skillet clean.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using the large holes on a box grater, coarsely grate
                        corn kernels from cobs into a large bowl (you should
                        have about 2 cups).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Melt remaining 2 Tbsp. butter with oil in same skillet
                        over medium-low heat. Add onion; cook, stirring often,
                        until soft and translucent (do not brown), 8–10 minutes.
                        Stir in flour. Add grated corn; increase heat to medium.
                        Cook, stirring often, until most of liquid evaporates
                        and corn is bright yellow, 2–3 minutes. Add cream; cook,
                        stirring frequently, until well blended and most of
                        liquid has evaporated, about 3 minutes. Stir in milk,
                        ham, 3/4 cup cheese, and reserved mushrooms. Cook,
                        stirring often, until flavors begin to meld, 1–2 minutes
                        longer. Season with salt and pepper.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Transfer corn mixture to a large bowl. Season eggs with
                        salt and pepper. Add to corn mixture; stir gently to
                        blend. Pour into prepared baking dish; sprinkle with 2
                        Tbsp. cheese. Set dish in a roasting pan; place in oven.
                        Pour hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up
                        sides of baking dish (this will prevent eggs from
                        curdling).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bake until pudding is just set in the center (center
                        will jiggle very slightly when dish is nudged), 40–45
                        minutes. Use a ladle or turkey baster to remove about
                        half of water from roasting pan to prevent any hot water
                        from spilling when pan is lifted from oven. Remove
                        roasting pan with pudding from oven. Remove baking dish
                        from pan.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Preheat broiler. Return pudding to oven; broil until top
                        is golden brown in spots, 2–3 minutes. Let stand for at
                        least 15 minutes and up to 30 minutes before serving.
